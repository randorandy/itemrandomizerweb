# Super Metroid Item Randomizer for ROTATION

ROMs created with this tool must be rotated with strotlog's web tool here:
[https://strotlog.github.io/romhackizer/](https://strotlog.github.io/romhackizer/)

There is casual, expert and master logic!

* How I use:
* console: dotnet run
* browser: localhost:8888

Casual:
No hellruns or suitless maridia will be required. Wrecked ship can be accessed with HJB or Space+Gravity.
The only required techniques will be:
-regular walljumping
-infinite bomb jump
-1-tap short charge, which I think is required for Main St. Missile and WS Reserve. It also allows frog speedway spark.

Expert:
Hellruns and suitless maridia can be required.
Hellruns were tested to my ability level +1 tank.
Not all of the hardest techniques will be in logic.
Most notably, suitless walljumping without HJB for more than a screen is not required.


Master:
All hard tricks and items I was able to obtain with minimal loadout are in logic. Hellruns were tested to my ability.
